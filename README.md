# D&D 5E Monster Tracker
The D&D 5E Monster Tracker allows a user to lookup any monster from 5th edition and add them to a list that shows the monster's stats.

# Installation
The latest version of the D&D 5e Monster Tracker can be found at https://github.com/Transcuttle/phase-1-project.

# Use
At the top of the application, there is a search bar. Type either a full or partial name of a monster into the form and click the button to submit it. A list of matching monster names will appear on the left side of the screen. Hover the cursor over each of the names to get a preview of some of the stats of the monster. When you have found the monster you would like to track, click on the name or stats and it will add the monster to the right side of the screen. Once added, more stats will be available to view. Both sides of the screen have clear buttons used to clear out the lists.
